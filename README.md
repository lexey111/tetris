# WebGL 3D Tetris

This is my side project, written as a break from corporate front-end development. Do not expect anything special: it is my very first experience in game dev and 3d.

However, there are some things:
- intro,
- various interactive 3D frames,
- main game loop,
- keyboard controls,
- adaptive design,
- breath-taking gameplay,
- awesome sound effects.

Well, obviously it is an AAA title, and I use this to illustrate my [articles](https://medium.com) on Medium.
